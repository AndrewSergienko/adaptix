Add support for Pydantic models! Now you can work with pydantic models like any other:
construct from dict, serialize to dict, convert to any other model, and convert it to any other model.

Also you can use :func:`.integrations.pydantic.native_pydantic` to delegate loading and dumping to pydantic itself.
